 I recently worked on a project that predicts student grades by analyzing various features like study hours, sleep hours, attendance, and socioeconomic status. Here's a breakdown of the workflow:


1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Exploration**: Examined the dataset to uncover trends and relationships. A correlation matrix and heatmap revealed which factors had the strongest influence on grades.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Engineering**: Added meaningful features like:
   - `Study-to-Sleep Ratio`: Capturing balance in routines.
   - `Attendance-Study Interaction`: Highlighting the combined impact of effort and consistency.  
   Grouped socioeconomic scores into categories (`low`, `medium`, `high`) to make the data more insightful.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Normalization**: Scaled numerical data to a consistent range, ensuring all features contributed equally to the model.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Modeling with Random Forest**: Trained a machine learning model to predict grades, then analyzed feature importance to identify the biggest contributors to success.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Validation**: Split the data into training and testing sets to ensure the model‚Äôs predictions were accurate and reliable.


üéØ **Key Takeaways**:
- Thoughtful data preprocessing and feature engineering can significantly enhance predictive accuracy.
- Combining visualization and machine learning helps uncover actionable insights, such as the impact of study routines and attendance on grades.
